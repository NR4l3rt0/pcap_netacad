- What to expect in this repo 

This is a compendium of little projects I did while taking the PCAP course in Netacad. Which means that, they are variations of the practices since there exists many ways of doing and understanding things.


- Technologies I used

IDLE (so if you try them, be careful with how the spacing tabs or spaces are parsed).
Git.
Github.
Vi.


- What I've learned from it

In any case, since I look back to the time I took the course (one month and a half or so). I was just focused in finding out solutions with the few bugs as possible. But I didn't make any real testing, debugging, etc...  


For the same reason, from now on I will focus on improving the quality of the code and not just finding solutions. What means, I'll focus on writing cleaner code, safer from bugs (with the help of TDD or BDD beacuse that will help my understanding of the problems) and I'll be looking for optimization while letting it be adaptable for future changes.
